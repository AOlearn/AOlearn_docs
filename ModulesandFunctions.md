## Modules and Functions

The **aolearn** library is a collection of machine learning algorithms implemented in a modular fashion. Each module focuses on a specific type of machine learning technique, and each function within a module serves a distinct purpose—training models, making predictions, and handling classification tasks.

### **Modules Overview**

1. **Linear Regression (aolearn.linear_regression)**  
   - Implements simple linear regression using gradient descent for parameter optimization.

2. **Logistic Regression (aolearn.logistic)**  
   - Handles binary classification problems using logistic regression and the sigmoid function.

3. **Lasso Regression (aolearn.lasso)**  
   - Introduces L1 regularization to reduce overfitting and enforce sparsity in the model.

4. **Ridge Regression (aolearn.ridge)**  
   - Implements L2 regularization to reduce overfitting while keeping all features.

5. **Multiclass Logistic Regression (aolearn.multiclass_logistic)**  
   - Extends logistic regression to handle multiple classes using the softmax function.

6. **Naive Bayes (aolearn.naive_bayes)**  
   - A probabilistic classification method based on Bayes' theorem, assuming feature independence.

7. **k-Nearest Neighbors (aolearn.knn)**  
   - A non-parametric algorithm that classifies data points based on proximity to labeled examples.

8. **Clustering (aolearn.clustering)**  
   - Implements k-Means clustering for unsupervised learning and pattern discovery.

### **Functions Overview**

Each module is stored in a separate file within the **aolearn** package. These files contain:

- **Function Definitions**: Implementation of training and prediction functions.
- **Parameter Descriptions**: Explanation of inputs and outputs for each function.
- **Mathematical Concepts**: Descriptions of the algorithms and optimization techniques used.

#### **File Structure**
